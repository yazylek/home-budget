# 💸 Home-Budget – Personal Finance Dashboard

**Home-Budget** is a simple, modern web application designed to help users **manage their personal finances** by tracking incomes and expenses. This app is built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, and currently includes the core layout: **login page** and a **main dashboard view**.

🔧 This project is still in its early stages and is not fully functional — the backend is not yet integrated, so data is not persisted or loaded dynamically.
